              <p>I completed my B.Tech in Biomedical Engineering from SRMUH. I would confidently say that SRMUH is one of the best Universities. I got exposed to some excellent opportunities, and they referred me to IIT, for my first research paper. I also received four placement offers during the Campus Placements.</p>
